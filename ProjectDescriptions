RTC Specific Projects



*   Modular Learning - Create your own journey [3 Teams]
    *   Technical Areas: Web Design/Development, Software Design, UI/UX, Frontend, Backend
    *   Problem: Once a student joins RTC, they don’t necessarily know about all the resources that came before they joined (like webinars and even FB posts). We need a way for a new RTC member to plan their own learning path based on their different interests. Previous RTC resources need to be tagged with relevant career interest categories and made easily accessible/searchable.
    *   Example: If I join RTC and want to know more about PM careers I should be able to drag and drop RTC resources and create a 10 week summer learning plan for myself.
    *   Proposed Team Breakdown:
        *   Team 1: Modular Learning Console
            *   This team will focus on the front end UI/UX for this project
        *   Team 2: Modular Learning Content
            *   This team will focus on the backend to make sure that all RTC content is available and tagged automatically in the “Create your own journey” service
        *   Team 3: Modular Learning Data Collection (works closely with Team 1)
            *   This team will focus on collecting data from the service to inform us on popular choices for modules, common patterns in constructing journeys and informing templates for different career interests based on other similar users

*   Virtual RTC Onboarding Experience + Gamification [2 Teams]
    *   Technical Areas: Data Mining/Analysis, Software Design, Web Design/Development, UI/UX, Graphic Design, Backend software development, Frontend software development
    *   Problem: We currently have a lot of different documents and processes that we want new RTC fellows and members to follow when engaging with different RTC programs. We don’t have a good way of ensuring that the new RTC women read through all of these resources. This project will be to create a virtual onboarding experience for new RTC members including gamification where it’s useful. On the backend, we would need to collect data on who successfully completes which training and where people stumble with selecting the right answers so that we can adapt our own material to make those guidelines clearer.
    *   Example: [https://tinyurl.com/RTCProfessionalEtiquetteGuide](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2FRTCProfessionalEtiquetteGuide%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2F75bGMPAPIVn5zX1KXLdy-BcrhTPcvMO6rgoJZH0kD-S6sILQ82rxk_w&h=AT3rwP3n7dkgyW4wRVyS0Ziva6hUcbFzvxNEcCBK3n9keNZ4tqXpC0kHgefPHxTOlXKxnZg00XW55eL-PhHGsgc-sV1tbrIC5jlfc9G2TDUYZfkYtZvwr0edBAOVrtgTrc3oYu6jhxHiZPvZTVBe&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT2U4qK4_q4_yv57zuLT98sl6cizHpCY5iCEJBR5E-hWwJ1Qor8mlHjj4sZZ5LGPRfYley2c6aA4i8ifnieDMt42bxwMXrixYg3vCw9PPNecDw2gHA5b2cEpJFPoYTpHhZvcONhGrnjHZY-qAtszi-R98Op_SwdnFuz3q0Hk4qbsN8h27G3a9Q) could be gamified to have a virtual simulation of various networking/professional situations and users would be able to select the responses they think are appropriate. 
    *   Proposed Team Breakdown:
        *   Team 1: Onboarding Console
            *   This team will focus on the front end UI/UX for this project
        *   Team 2:Onboarding Infrastructure
            *   This team will focus on data collection and the relevant infrastructure on the backend of the onboarding service
    *   Point of contact: Myra Gupta, [mgupta@rewritingthecode.org](mailto:mgupta@rewritingthecode.org)
*   RTC Chat Bot [2 Teams]
    *   Technical Areas: Machine Learning, Software Design, Web Design, Backend software development, Frontend software development
    *   Problem: RTC leadership often struggles with a huge volume of repetitive questions from students about different RTC procedures. There is room to automate this process so that leaders aren’t bogged down with menial questions and so that there is a single source of information for common questions that can get people instantaneous answers. On the backend, we could track common questions and make sure that the chat bot is updated with the most relevant information. A simpler scope project would have this learning be manual, a more complex project could use some AI in the background.
    *   Example: There are many posts on Facebook during the Fellowship application period about who can apply for the fellowship and when decisions will be released. A chat bot could easily spit out the answers to these questions.
    *   Proposed Team Breakdown:
        *   Team 1: Chat Bot Console
            *   This team will focus on the front end UI/UX for this project
        *   Team 2: Chat Bot Infrastructure
            *   This team will focus on getting data for and training the chat bot
    *   Point of contact: Myra Gupta, mgupta@rewritingthecode.org
*   Data Visualization Pipeline [3 Teams]
    *   Technical Areas: Data Engineering, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Software Design, UI/UX, Backend software development
    *   Problem: We currently collect data from RTC students through a variety of different sources and for different purposes - some for internal metrics on whether RTC programs are successful and others that we share with the community and with companies. Once we collect data, there is often a manual process in creating visualizations and presenting it to the relevant stakeholders. This project would entail identifying all the RTC data sources and building pipelines to automatically generate visualizations.
    *   Example: The alumni program leaders sent out a survey to ask alumni about what they’re looking for in their next jobs, when they plan on switching careers and which companies they’re interested in working with. The visualizations for this data have to be manually regenerated every month and transferred from Airtable to a shareable platform.
    *   Proposed Team Breakdown:
        *   Team 1: Student Profiles
            *   This team will focus on collecting, organizing and presenting student profile data in a way that is continuous and allows us to map the timeline of each student in RTC
                *   Specific areas of focus:
                    *   Pre-College Data 
                        *   a. High School: name, location, ranking by the number of RTC students, colleges where they matriculate. We have this info in Airtable. Would be great to have visualizations - perhaps a map displaying HS school location and location of the schools (I’d like to see such a map for colleges and the top 20 companies/locations of where they head. I.e., Cornell interns/grads go where, as well as displaying Amazon, what are the top 20 schools for internships and full time 
                        *   b. HS State origin - compare to the states where their colleges are located
                        *   c. Hometowns - usually correlates to the high school location, but international students, boarding schools impact this data. I like to share downtown info as well as college location with regional companies who recruit and would prefer a regional approach rather than national approach to recruiting interns and FT candidates
                        *   d. High CS dept/CS faculty - see in the attached spreadsheet. Cassidy used the data from Airtable and then had to manually research the dpt website/CS faculty. Would be helpful to build out at least the top 50 high schools by #RTC alums so that we can contact HS to raise awareness of RTC - offer the [RTC Bridge Program](https://rewritingthecode.org/bridge-program/) to graduating seniors.
                        *   e. 1st Gen
                    *   International Students
                        *   intl students who attend colleges/universities in the US
                            *   a. Country of origin
                            *   b. Sponsorship - yes/no
                            *   c. 1st gen - yes/no
                            *   d. Companies where they intern/work
                            *   e. Ethnicity
                        *   intl students who are part of RTC yet attend college outside the US. The later is a possible area for collaborations with RTC.
                            *   a. Country
                            *   b. Top colleges/university
        *   Team 2: Job Search Data 
            *   This team will focus on collecting, organizing and presenting data from students’ job searches (including pre-summer and post-summer surveys) in a way that is easily accessible and has different “views” for different stakeholders i.e. students vs. RTC leadership vs. company partners
        *   Team 3: College Profiles
            *   This team will focus on collecting and aggregating data at the college level and will focus on building views that allow students to identify other RTC members and alumni from their own universities.
    *   Point of contact: Myra Gupta, mgupta@rewritingthecode.org
*   Job Board [3 Teams]
    *   Technical Areas: Database development, Web design, UI/UX, Frontend software development
    *   Problem: We need a single student-facing place to post all RTC partner company opportunities (jobs+internships). We currently post opportunities to our Facebook group but they are difficult to find with the traffic of our group. There are also a lot of opportunities sourced from students themselves (not necessarily from our partner companies) that get posted on Facebook and then lost in the jumble of posts. We need a way to automatically populate these posts into a jobs portal (there may be Facebook APIs we could use for this)
    *   Example: In the past we have used Airtable, creating a form for the company to fill out which feeds a database we can then share with our students. The problem with this solution was that companies wouldn't take the time to fill out the form and the student-facing side was not very visually appealing. We need something simple for the companies (like pasting in a URL) but nice looking and easy to navigate on the student end.
    *   Proposed Team Breakdown:
        *   Team 1: Job Board Console
            *   This team will focus on the front end UI/UX for this project
        *   Team 2: Job Board Infrastructure
            *   This team will focus on getting data for and building an automated pipeline for collecting the opportunities that feed the job board
        *   Team 3: Job Board Data Collection (works closely with Team 1)
            *   This team will focus on finding ways to collect data from the Job Board on which opportunities are most appealing for RTC students, most clicked, most applied to, etc.

*   RTC Volunteer Opportunities Board + Task Tracking [1 Team]
    *   Technical Areas: Database development, Web design, UI/UX, Frontend software development, implementing and researching existing softwares
    *   Problem: We need a better way to post RTC’s many volunteer and leadership opportunities so that students can find them easily and so that leaders have a quick view of who is supposed to be working on what tasks. There will need to be an RTC-wide view as well as views specific to the different sub-groups i.e. Sue+Jade+Staff, RTC Alumni Board, RTC Student Council. 
    *   Example: Some tasks are left floating because we aren’t actively tracking them i.e. the alumni community needed to revamp our office hours program and we mentioned it frequently but never assigned an owner and weren’t clear on the status of the project at different points.
    *   Proposed Team Breakdown:
        *   1 single team will complete the entirety of this project
