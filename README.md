# Rewrite Your Summer 2020

Everyone in the Rewriting the Code community has been impacted in one way or another by the pandemic.
On-campus classes and activities have been halted, leaving students with extra time on their hands. Many
internships have been canceled, creating uncertainty for thousands of students regarding what they’ll be doing
this upcoming summer.

Despite the unfortunate circumstances, this is an opportunity to realize visions, meet and collaborate with
others in the community, and learn new skills through technical projects. For women whose internships have
been cancelled, RTC plans to engage our company partners to help our passionate and skilled women, many
of whom have already demonstrated interest in using their newly-found time productively, to make the most of
their time. 

# The Rewrite Your Summer program will:
• Provide students the opportunity to participate in a meaningful summer project with peers and mentors
in the absence of a traditional internship where they will develop code, project solutions, and work
artifacts for use during the 2020 fall recruiting season.
• Help students ideate projects and create solutions they’re passionate about.
• Create opportunities for students to develop and learn team, technical, and business skills through
hands-on experience and collaboration.
• Further develop and strengthen relationships within the RTC community.
• Expose students to RTC company partner engineers and recruiters.
