# Rewrite Your Summer Project Timeline
## Week 1 - Introductions + Stakeholder Input
* Students should set up a [team charter](https://www.lce.com/Team-Charters-What-are-they-1219.html) and form consensus on the team’s code of conduct.
* The team should establish a [daily stand up time](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/daily-meeting/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'daily*20meeting))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)) and start attending this daily meeting. 
* All team members should familiarize themselves with [Git](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github).
* Collecting Stakeholder Data:
  * The team should discuss the project’s problem statement and scope and define any remaining questions they have for key stakeholders (i.e. project points of contact and the RTC community at large).
  * All RTC project questions for stakeholders should be grouped into an RTC-wide “Tech Survey” and sent to the entire RTC community to get input on people’s experiences with different RTC processes.
i.e. If the project is to build an RTC Job Board, the team would develop questions around what challenges the RTC community faces when trying to find opportunities that have been shared with the community. The tech survey would include a section for each team’s questions.
* Team reviews their questions for the RTC Tech Survey with their mentors and gets feedback.
* Final tech survey is sent out to the RTC community and results are shared with all team members.
* Mentor expectations: Review team charter and team’s proposed tech survey questions + provide feedback. Answer any lingering questions about Git.
